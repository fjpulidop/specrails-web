# Implementation Pipeline

Full OpenSpec lifecycle with specialized agents: architect designs, developer implements, reviewer validates and archives. Handles 1 to N features — adapts automatically (sequential for 1, parallel with worktrees for N).

**MANDATORY: Always follow this pipeline exactly as written. NEVER skip, shortcut, or "optimize away" any phase — even if the task seems simple enough to do directly. The orchestrator MUST launch the architect, developer, and reviewer agents as specified. Do NOT implement changes yourself in the main conversation; delegate to the agents defined in each phase. No exceptions.**

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS — accepts three modes:

1. **Issue numbers** (recommended): `#85, #71, #63` — implement these specific GitHub Issues directly. Skips exploration and selection.
2. **Text description** (single feature): `"add price history chart"` — implement a single feature from a description. Skips exploration and selection.
3. **Area names** (fallback): `Analytics, UI, Testing` — explores areas and picks the best items. Only use if no backlog issues exist.

**IMPORTANT:** Before running, ensure Read/Write/Bash/Glob/Grep permissions are set to "allow" — background agents cannot request permissions interactively.

---

## Phase -1: Environment Setup (cloud pre-flight)

**This phase runs BEFORE anything else.** Detect if we're in a cloud/remote environment and ensure all required tools are available.

### Detection

Check the environment variable `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`. If it contains `remote_mobile` or `remote_web`, OR if `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` is `true`, we're in a **cloud environment**.

### Checks to run (sequential, fail-fast)

#### 1. GitHub CLI authentication

```bash
gh auth status 2>&1
```

- Set `GH_AVAILABLE=true/false` for later phases.

#### 2. OpenSpec CLI

```bash
which openspec && openspec --version
```

- If missing: try `npm install -g @openspec/cli`
- If install fails: **STOP** — openspec is required.

#### 3. Project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Test runner

```bash
npx vitest --version
```

### Summary

Print a setup report:

```
## Environment Setup
| Tool | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Backlog provider | ok/missing | GitHub Issues |
| OpenSpec | ok | ... |
| Dependencies | ok | ... |
| Test runner | ok | Vitest |
```

**Pass `TEST_CMD` (or equivalent) and `BACKLOG_AVAILABLE` forward** — all later phases must use these.

---

## Phase 0: Parse input and determine mode

### Flag Detection

Before parsing input, scan `$ARGUMENTS` for control flags:

- If `--dry-run` or `--preview` is present in `$ARGUMENTS`:
  - Set `DRY_RUN=true`
  - Strip the flag from the arguments before further parsing
  - Print: `[dry-run] Preview mode active — no git, PR, or backlog operations will run.`
  - Set `CACHE_DIR=.claude/.dry-run/<kebab-case-feature-name>` (derive after parsing the remaining input)
  - Note: if a cache already exists at `CACHE_DIR`, print `[dry-run] Overwriting existing cache at CACHE_DIR` before overwriting.

- If `--apply <feature-name>` is present in `$ARGUMENTS`:
  - Set `APPLY_MODE=true`
  - Set `APPLY_TARGET=<feature-name>` (the argument immediately following `--apply`)
  - Set `CACHE_DIR=.claude/.dry-run/<feature-name>`
  - Verify `CACHE_DIR` exists. If it does not: print `[apply] Error: no cached dry-run found at CACHE_DIR` and stop.
  - Skip Phases 1–4b. Go directly to Phase 4c (the apply path handles the rest).
  - Strip `--apply` and the feature name before further parsing.

If neither flag is present: `DRY_RUN=false`, `APPLY_MODE=false`. Pipeline runs as normal.

Note: `CACHE_DIR` for `--dry-run` is finalized after the feature name is derived from the remaining input. All subsequent phases that reference `CACHE_DIR` have access to it.

---

**If the user passed a text description** (e.g. `"add feature X"`):
- **Single-feature mode**. Derive a kebab-case change name.
- Set `SINGLE_MODE = true`. No worktrees, no parallelism.
- **Skip Phase 1 and Phase 2** — go directly to Phase 3a.

**If the user passed issue/ticket references** (e.g. `#85, #71`):
- Fetch each issue:
  ```bash
  gh issue view {number} --json number,title,labels,body
  ```
- Extract area, value, effort, and feature details from each issue body.
- If only 1 issue: set `SINGLE_MODE = true`.
- **Skip Phase 1 and Phase 2** — go directly to confirmation table.

**If the user passed area names**:
- Check for open backlog issues. If found, filter and pick top 3.
- If none, proceed to Phase 1.

---

## Phase 1: Explore (parallel)

**Only runs if Phase 0 found no backlog issues AND user passed area names.**

For each area, launch a **product-manager** agent (`subagent_type: product-manager`, `run_in_background: true`).

Wait for all to complete. Read their output.

## Phase 2: Select

**Only runs if Phase 1 ran.**

Pick the single idea with the best impact/effort ratio from each exploration. Present to user and wait for confirmation.

## Phase 3a: Architect (parallel, in main repo)

For each chosen idea, launch an **architect** agent (`subagent_type: architect`, `run_in_background: true`).

Each architect creates OpenSpec artifacts in `openspec/changes/<name>/`.

Each agent's prompt should include:
- Description of the feature
- Context from exploration (if applicable)
- Instructions to create: proposal.md, design.md, delta-spec, tasks.md, context-bundle.md
- Tags for each task: `[frontend]`

### 3a.1 Identify shared file conflicts

**Only runs in multi-feature mode** (more than one feature). Skip entirely if `SINGLE_MODE=true`.

After all architect agents complete, before launching any developer agent:

#### Step 1: Extract file references

For each `openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md`, extract all paths listed under `**Files:**` entries (both `Create:` and `Modify:` lines). Normalize paths: strip leading `./`.

#### Step 2: Build the shared-file registry

Group file paths across all features. Any path appearing in two or more features' task lists is a **shared file**. Store as `SHARED_FILES` map: `{path: {features: [...], risk: ""}}`.

#### Step 3: Classify risk

For each shared file, classify risk based on file type and which regions each feature modifies (consult each feature's context-bundle.md "Exact Changes" section):

| Risk | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| `low` | Both features only append new named sections not present in the other feature's changes |
| `medium` | Both features modify structurally distinct regions (different `##` sections or different top-level YAML keys) |
| `high` | Both features modify the same region (same `##` section, same YAML key subtree, or any region in shell scripts) |

Shell scripts (`.sh`, `.bash`): always `high`.
Non-existent files that two features both create: always `high`.

#### Step 4: Derive MERGE_ORDER

Sort features so that for any pair sharing a `high`-risk file, one appears before the other. Use topological sort; break ties alphabetically. Set `MERGE_ORDER` = sorted feature list.

#### Step 5: Print pre-flight report

```
## Shared File Analysis

| File | Features | Risk |
|------|----------|------|
| <path> | <feature-a>, <feature-b> | <risk> |

Merge order: <feature-a> → <feature-b> → <feature-c>

High-risk files detected. These files will be merged sequentially.
Developers will still run in parallel — merge order applies at Phase 4a only.
```

If no shared files: print `No shared files detected. All features modify independent files.`

### 3a.2 Pre-validate architect output

Quick-check each architect's artifacts:
1. tasks.md exists and has tasks
2. context-bundle.md exists
3. File references are real (>70% must exist)
4. Layer tags present on tasks

## Phase 3b: Implement

### Pre-flight: Verify Bash permission

Before launching any developer agent, run a trivial Bash command to confirm Bash is allowed.

### Launch developers

**Read reviewer learnings:** Check `.claude/agent-memory/reviewer/common-fixes.md` and include in developer prompts.

#### Dry-Run: Redirect developer writes

**If `DRY_RUN=true`**, include the following in every developer agent prompt:

> IMPORTANT: This is a dry-run. Write all new or modified files under:
>   .claude/.dry-run/\<feature-name\>/
>
> Mirror the real destination path within this directory. For example:
>   Real path:   src/utils/parser.ts
>   Write to:    .claude/.dry-run/\<feature-name\>/src/utils/parser.ts
>
> Do NOT write to real file paths. After writing each file, append an entry
> to .claude/.dry-run/\<feature-name\>/.cache-manifest.json using this JSON format:
>   {"cached_path": "...", "real_path": "...", "operation": "create|modify"}

**If `DRY_RUN=false`**: developer agent instructions are unchanged.

#### Choosing the right developer agent

For each feature, analyze the tasks' layer tags:

- If all tasks are tagged `[frontend]`: use `frontend-developer` agent
- If tasks span multiple layers or are untagged: use `developer` agent (full-stack)

#### Launch modes

**If `SINGLE_MODE`**: Launch in the main repo, foreground.
**If multiple features**: Launch in isolated worktrees (`isolation: worktree`, `run_in_background: true`).

Wait for all developers to complete.

## Phase 3c: Write Tests

Launch a **test-writer** agent for each feature immediately after its developer completes.

Construct the agent invocation prompt to include:
- **IMPLEMENTED_FILES_LIST**: the complete list of files the developer created or modified for this feature
- **TASK_DESCRIPTION**: the original task or feature description that drove the implementation

### Launch modes

**If `SINGLE_MODE`**: Launch a single test-writer agent in the foreground (`run_in_background: false`). Wait for it to complete before proceeding to Phase 4.

**If multiple features (worktrees)**: Launch one test-writer agent per feature, each in its corresponding worktree (`isolation: worktree`, `run_in_background: true`). Wait for all test-writer agents to complete before proceeding to Phase 4.

### Dry-run behavior

**If `DRY_RUN=true`**, include in every test-writer agent prompt:

> IMPORTANT: This is a dry-run. Write all new or modified test files under:
>   .claude/.dry-run/\<feature-name\>/
>
> Mirror the real destination path within this directory. After writing each file, append an entry
> to .claude/.dry-run/\<feature-name\>/.cache-manifest.json using:
>   {"cached_path": "...", "real_path": "...", "operation": "create"}

### Failure handling

If a test-writer agent fails or times out:
- Record `Tests: FAILED` for that feature in the Phase 4e report
- Continue to Phase 4 — the test-writer failure is non-blocking
- Include in the reviewer agent prompt: "Note: the test-writer failed for this feature. Check for coverage gaps."

## Phase 3d: Doc Sync

Launch a **doc-sync** agent for each feature after its tests are written.

Construct the agent invocation prompt to include:
- **IMPLEMENTED_FILES_LIST**: the complete list of files the developer created or modified for this feature
- **TASK_DESCRIPTION**: the original task or feature description that drove the implementation

### Launch modes

**If `SINGLE_MODE`**: Launch a single doc-sync agent in the foreground (`run_in_background: false`). Wait for it to complete before proceeding to Phase 4.

**If multiple features (worktrees)**: Launch one doc-sync agent per feature, each in its corresponding worktree (`isolation: worktree`, `run_in_background: true`). Wait for all doc-sync agents to complete before proceeding to Phase 4.

### Dry-run behavior

**If `DRY_RUN=true`**, include in every doc-sync agent prompt:

> IMPORTANT: This is a dry-run. Write all new or modified doc files under:
>   .claude/.dry-run/\<feature-name\>/
>
> Mirror the real destination path within this directory. After writing each file, append an entry
> to .claude/.dry-run/\<feature-name\>/.cache-manifest.json using:
>   {"cached_path": "...", "real_path": "...", "operation": "create|modify"}

### Failure handling

If a doc-sync agent fails or times out:
- Record `Docs: FAILED` for that feature in the Phase 4e report
- Continue to Phase 4 — the doc-sync failure is non-blocking
- Include in the reviewer agent prompt: "Note: the doc-sync agent failed for this feature."

## Phase 4: Merge & Review

**This phase is fully autonomous.**

### 4a. Merge worktree changes to main repo

- If `SINGLE_MODE`: skip (no worktrees were used). Proceed to Phase 4b.
- If `DRY_RUN=true`: apply the merge algorithm below, writing all outputs to `CACHE_DIR/<file-path>` instead of the main repo working tree. Do NOT clean up worktrees in dry-run mode.
- Otherwise: apply the merge algorithm below, writing outputs to the main repo working tree. Clean up worktrees at the end.

#### Merge Algorithm

Process features in `MERGE_ORDER` sequence. For each feature:

**Step 1: Identify changed files**

```bash
git -C <worktree-path> diff main --name-only
```

Split into `exclusive_files` (only this feature modifies them) and `shared_files_for_this_feature` (also modified by another feature in MERGE_ORDER).

**Step 2: Merge exclusive files**

Copy directly from worktree to target:
```bash
cp <worktree-path>/<file> <target>/<file>
```
Log: `Copied (exclusive): <file>`

**Step 3: Merge shared files**

For each shared file, choose strategy by file type:

**Strategy A — Markdown section-aware merge** (`.md` files):
1. Read base: current content of `<target>/<file>`.
2. Read incoming: `<worktree-path>/<file>`.
3. Parse both into sections using `##` heading boundaries.
4. Merge: new sections appended, identical kept, conflicts marked.

**Strategy B — Unified diff sequential apply** (all other file types):
1. Generate incoming diff against original `main`
2. Apply to current target with `patch --forward --fuzz=3`
3. If `patch` fails: insert conflict markers around rejected hunks.

**Step 4: Record outcomes and emit merge report**

**Step 5: Clean up worktrees** (skip if `DRY_RUN=true`)

### 4b. Launch Reviewer agent

Launch a single **reviewer** agent to validate ALL merged changes. Include:
- Full CI commands
- Cross-feature merge issue checks
- Record learnings to `common-fixes.md`
- Archive completed changes via OpenSpec

### 4b-sec. Launch Security Reviewer agent

After the reviewer agent completes, launch a **security-reviewer** agent (`subagent_type: security-reviewer`).

Construct the agent invocation prompt to include:
- **MODIFIED_FILES_LIST**: the complete list of files created or modified during this implementation run
- **PIPELINE_CONTEXT**: brief description — feature names and change names implemented
- The exemptions config path: `.claude/security-exemptions.yaml`

Wait for the security-reviewer to complete. Parse the final line of its output:
- `SECURITY_STATUS: BLOCKED` → set `SECURITY_BLOCKED=true`
- `SECURITY_STATUS: WARNINGS` → set `SECURITY_BLOCKED=false`, capture warning summary
- `SECURITY_STATUS: CLEAN` → set `SECURITY_BLOCKED=false`

### 4c. Ship — Git & backlog updates

**Security gate:** If `SECURITY_BLOCKED=true`:
1. Print all Critical findings from the security-reviewer output
2. Do NOT create a branch, commit, push, or PR
3. Print: "Pipeline blocked by security findings. Fix the Critical issues listed above and re-run /implement."
4. Skip to Phase 4e.

### Dry-Run Gate

**If `DRY_RUN=true`:**
Print: `[dry-run] Skipping all git and backlog operations.`
Then skip the rest of Phase 4c and proceed directly to Phase 4e.

**If `APPLY_MODE=true`:**
1. Read `.cache-manifest.json` from `CACHE_DIR`.
2. Copy cached files to real locations.
3. Proceed with Phase 4c normally.

**Otherwise:** proceed as normal.

---

This phase respects the `GIT_AUTO` and `BACKLOG_WRITE` settings from configuration.

#### If `GIT_AUTO=true` (automatic shipping)

1. Create branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/<descriptive-name>`
2. One commit per feature with descriptive messages
3. If the reviewer modified files, create an additional commit: `fix: resolve CI issues (reviewer)`
4. Push with `-u` flag: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
5. Create PR (if GitHub CLI is available):
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   <bullet points>

   ## Changes
   <file list>

   ## Test Plan
   <testing notes>

   Closes #<issue-number>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

#### If `GIT_AUTO=false` (manual shipping)

Do NOT create branches, commits, or push. Display a summary instead.

#### Backlog updates (both modes)

**If `BACKLOG_WRITE=true`:**
- For fully resolved issues: add a comment noting completion and reference the PR.
  ```bash
  gh issue comment {number} --body "Implemented in PR #XX. All acceptance criteria met."
  ```
- Ensure the PR body includes `Closes #N` for each fully resolved issue.

**If `BACKLOG_WRITE=false`:**
- Display what the user should update manually.

### 4d. Monitor CI

**Only if `GIT_AUTO=true` and code was pushed.**

Check CI status after pushing. Fix failures (up to 2 retries).

### 4e. Report

Print the final pipeline report table:

```
| Area | Feature | Change Name | Architect | Developer | Tests | Docs | Reviewer | Security | CI | Status |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------|------|----------|----------|----|--------|
```

---

## Error Handling

- If a product-manager fails: skip that area, continue with others
- If an architect fails: skip that area, report the failure
- If a developer fails: report which phase it failed at
- If the reviewer finds unfixable issues: report them, push what works
- Never block the entire pipeline on a single agent failure. Always produce a final report.
